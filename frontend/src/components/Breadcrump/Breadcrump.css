/* Breadcrumbs are a navigational 
aid that allows users to keep 
track of their current location 
on a website or interface. A
breadcrumb trail displays the
page a user is currently on 
and its relation to the pages 
they visited before it, or the 
hierarchy of higher level parent 
pages above the current page 
eg: Home/women/jeans/momjeans
